 - populate_and_survey.py
   This script calls first the populate script, and then 
   the dosurvey script. Instead of writing the population
   model to disk and then reading it back into memory again,
   the model is kept in memory between the two steps, which
   speeds up the process. The model can still be written
   to disk at any point, as is demonstrated in the script.
